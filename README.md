PROJECT - Interactive histogram of masses of three different species of penguin

OVERVIEW - The Palmer Penguins dataset is a widely used resource for data science and machine learning education. It offers a more approachable and engaging alternative to the classic Iris dataset, featuring real-world biological data collected from penguin species in Antarctica.

Species Included: Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.

Sample Size: 344 individual penguins.

Location: Three islands in the Palmer Archipelago Antarctica—Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen.

Data Collection Period: 2007–2009, as part of the Palmer Station Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program led by Dr. Kristen Gorman.

The curated penguins dataset includes the following variables.

species: Penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap, Gentoo).

island: Island where the penguin was observed.

bill_length_mm: Length of the penguin's bill (in millimeters).
,
bill_depth_mm: Depth of the penguin's bill (in millimeters).

flipper_length_mm: Length of the penguin's flipper (in millimeters).

body_mass_g: Body mass of the penguin (in grams) -- THIS VARIABLE WAS USED TO CREATE THE HISTOGRAM FOR THIS PROJECT.

sex: Sex of the penguin (male or female).

year: Year the observation was made.

DESCRIPTION OF INTERACTIVE HISTOGRAM - In the left upper part of the graphic, there is a dropdown menu entitled "Select Species," which allows the user to select a species, with the output for that species displayed on the histogram. There is just below this a slidebar entitled "Number of bins," where the user can choose betwen 5 and 50 bins on the histogram, with the output displayed again in the histogram.
